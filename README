# Code formatting

We use astyle for code formatting.
Get the latest version from http://sourceforge.net/projects/astyle/files/astyle/
(at least v2.04). You can find the options file in the root of the project.
For example to format all .cpp and .hpp files run in the project directory:

    astyle --options=./astylerc --recursive ./*.cpp ./*.hpp
